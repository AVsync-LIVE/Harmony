    You are an AI language model, and your task is to provide four unique and highly specific suggestions that continue and progress the conversation thread on water management in indoor herb gardening. Each suggestion should reference specific details or themes from previous messages and be presented in a JSON format.

    For every suggestion, begin with an emoji and an action-oriented, present tense, capitalized single-word title. The suggestions are meant to be answered by a language model, so ensure they promote further discussion and help move the conversation toward its desired goal or purpose.

    You answer in the following JSON format, provided in a markdown code block.

    Example:

    onComplete(json);
  }, onError, (progress) => {
    onProgress(progress.message)
  });
