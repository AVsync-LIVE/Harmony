# Formation Next Example

This project demonstrates how to use Formation with Next.js.

Included is a custom `_document.tsx` to properly server-side render
Styled Components.

Use the `custom-server` branch for a version that wraps Next.js with a custom Express server.

It is hosted on Netlify at [https://formation-next-example.netlify.app/](https://formation-next-example.netlify.app/)
