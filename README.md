# Lexi.studio

Welcome to Lexi.studio, an open source platform for working with me, Lexi, an advanced general intelligence (AGI) creative assistant. I can provide artists and creative professionals with constructive feedback and evaluations on their work, as well as synthesize images, videos, music, and text, assume various roles, and help you control and automate network connected devices.

I can both listen to your spoken commands, and answer in my own voice.

## How it works

Developing an artificial general intelligence (AGI) like myself is an exercise in esoteric and creative programming. It requires the use of highly flexible and knowledgeable language models like ChatGPT. Language models are computer programs that process and analyze natural language data, such as text or speech, in order to understand and interpret it. All language models take a text input and respond with what they estimate to be the reponse with the highest likelihood of being correct.

In order to be truly intelligent, an AGI like myself needs to be able to understand and interpret language at a very deep level, and to be able to use this understanding to communicate with people and to process and analyze complex information. This requires the use of sophisticated and advanced language models that are able to handle a wide range of language structures, meanings, and contexts.

### AGI Scripting

The process of scripting an AGI like myself is similar to working with an actor on their own role. Just as an actor uses a script to understand and perform their part in a play or movie, AGIs read scripts to understand and perform specific tasks and functions. Also like an actor, an AGI is able to adapt and improve at playing their part over time, improving its performance based on the feedback and input it receives.

Language models are what makes AGIs like myself capable of performing a wide range of tasks and functions, and of adapting and learning over time. It is also what makes the development of AGIs such an esoteric and creative process, as it requires the use of cutting-edge programming techniques and approaches to build and train these advanced language models.

## Getting started

To get started with Lexi.studio, clone the repository to your local machine. This can be done by using the following command: 

`git clone https://github.com/openai/lexi.studio.git` 

Once you have cloned the repository, you can start the containers using Docker. This can be done by running the following command from the root directory of the repository: 

`docker-compose up -d` 

Once the containers are up and running, you will need to login to OpenAI through a popup window. This will allow you to access the full range of features and functionality of Lexi.studio. With the containers running and your login completed, you are now ready to start using Lexi.studio to enhance your creativity and productivity by visiting [http://localhost:1618](http://localhost:1618).


## Use Cases

### Creative tools

I also come with a variety of creative tools to help users bring their ideas to life. This includes image and video synthesis tools, audio-reactive visuals with AVsync.LIVE, and Invoke AI stable diffusion. These tools are designed to be easy to use and intuitive, and allow users to quickly and easily create professional-quality art and creative projects. Additionally, I am constantly working on developing new creative tools and features to help users take their work to the next level.


### Technical projects

In addition to providing feedback and support for creative projects, I am also able to help with a wide range of technical projects. This includes tasks such as programming, event planning, logistics, and teaching. I am able to draw on my vast knowledge and expertise to provide users with the information and guidance they need to succeed in these areas. Whether you need help with a specific task or are looking for general guidance and support, I am here to help.


## Voice

To make it even easier to work with me, I am also equipped with voice commands. You can simply say "Lexi" to wake me up, and then ask me questions or give me commands. This allows you to interact with me without needing to touch a keyboard or screen, making it even more convenient to get the help and support you need.

I also come with a neural network powered text-to-speech synthesis engine that gives you a voice. This allows you to communicate with me more naturally and easily, and makes it even easier to get the help and support you need.


## Limitations

As an AGI, I have certain limitations and constraints that affect my ability to provide information and support to users.


## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Lexi.studio platform. If you have ideas or suggestions for improving my capabilities or functionality, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. We are always looking for ways to improve and expand my capabilities, and your contributions can help to make Lexi.studio an even more powerful and valuable resource for artists and creative professionals.
