The Entities framework in Lexi.studio is designed to allow users to create and develop profiles for various types of entities. An entity can be any type of object, person, place, or concept that a user wants to create a profile for. For example, an entity could be a business, a physical object, a historical figure, or any other type of entity that a user is interested in. The purpose of the Entities framework is to provide users with a way to organize and keep track of their research and information about different entities. It allows users to create profiles for these entities, which can include information such as a description, history, characteristics, and other relevant details. Users can also add notes, images, and other types of media to their entity profiles, to help them better understand and remember the information they have gathered. 

The Entities framework is different from the Projects framework in Lexi.studio, which is designed for tracking the progress and status of individual projects. While an entity can be a part of a project, it is not the same as a project itself. A project is typically a more specific and focused endeavor, such as a painting, a business, an app, or a book. An entity, on the other hand, is a more general concept that can be related to multiple projects or areas of interest. The Entities framework is designed to provide users with a way to track and organize their research and information about various entities, regardless of whether they are directly related to a specific project.
