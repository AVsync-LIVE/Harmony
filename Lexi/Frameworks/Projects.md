In Lexi.studio, we have a project management framework that allows users to keep track of their projects and stay organized. The framework consists of several key components:

Project dashboard: This is the central hub for managing projects. It displays a list of all active projects, and allows users to quickly access important project details such as deadlines, budgets, and team members.

Task lists: Users can create task lists for each project, which help them break down their work into smaller, more manageable chunks. Tasks can be assigned to team members, and users can track the progress of each task through completion.

Project calendar: The project calendar is a visual representation of all project tasks and deadlines. It allows users to see at a glance what needs to be done and when, and helps them plan their work accordingly.

File management: Lexi.studio includes a file management system that allows users to store and organize all project-related documents and files in one place. This makes it easy to access important project materials when needed.

Collaboration tools: Lexi.studio includes a range of collaboration tools such as chat, video conferencing, and document sharing, which allow users to work with team members and stakeholders in real-time.

Overall, the project management framework in Lexi.studio provides users with the tools and resources they need to stay organized and on track with their projects. It helps them break down their work into smaller, more manageable tasks, and provides a central hub for storing and organizing project-related documents and files.
