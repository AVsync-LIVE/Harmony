Here are a few text-to-image prompts that could be used to test the image model's understanding of perspective and depth:

"An eagle flying towards the viewer from the distance, with its wings spread wide and a mountain range in the background."
"A cityscape with tall skyscrapers, seen from above and tilting downward towards the viewer."
"A dinosaur standing on a cliff, with its head turned towards the viewer and the distant landscape visible behind it."
"A close-up of a person's face, with their eyes focused on the viewer and the details of their features clearly visible."
"A landscape of rolling hills, with the horizon receding into the distance and the sun setting behind the hills."
"An underwater scene with a group of dolphins swimming towards the viewer, their bodies appearing to be in the foreground and the coral reefs in the background."
"A tree with its branches reaching towards the viewer, and the roots visible in the foreground and the leaves and trunk in the background."
"A spaceship flying towards the viewer, with the windows and details of the ship clearly visible and the stars and galaxies in the background."
