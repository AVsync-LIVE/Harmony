Stable Diffusion is a machine learning system that is used for generating images from text descriptions, as well as for altering existing images based on text input. It is composed of several different components, including a text encoder, an image generator, and an image decoder.

The text encoder is a special Transformer language model that converts the input text into a numerical representation, or vector, for each word or token in the text. This representation is then passed on to the image generator, which is made up of two components: an image information creator and an image decoder.

The image information creator is the "secret sauce" of Stable Diffusion, and is responsible for generating image information in the latent space (a space in which the image is represented as a set of numbers rather than pixel values). It consists of a UNet neural network and a scheduling algorithm, and is faster than previous models that worked in pixel space.

The image decoder then takes the image information generated by the information creator and converts it into a final pixel image. Stable Diffusion is versatile in that it can be used in a variety of ways, including text-to-image generation and image-to-image transformation, and has been noted for its high performance in terms of image quality, speed, and low resource and memory requirements.
